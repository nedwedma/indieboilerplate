# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture and design principles of the Antimetal boilerplate.

## Core Technologies

The Antimetal boilerplate is built on the following core technologies:

- **Next.js**: The React framework for production, providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and the App Router.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **NextAuth.js**: A complete authentication solution for Next.js applications.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable:

```

│   └── styles/        # Global styles
```

## App Router Structure

The Antimetal boilerplate uses Next.js App Router, which provides a file-system based router built on top of Server Components. The structure is as follows:

- **Route Groups**: Folders with names in parentheses like `(auth)` and `(site)` are route groups. They don't affect the URL path but help organize the code.
- **Layouts**: Each section can have its own layout defined in a `layout.tsx` file.
- **Pages**: Each route has a `page.tsx` file that defines the main content of the page.
- **Loading States**: Optional `loading.tsx` files define loading UI for the route.
- **Error Handling**: Optional `error.tsx` files define error UI for the route.

## Component Architecture

Components are organized into several categories:

- **UI Components**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and cards.
- **Navigation Components**: Components related to site navigation, like the navbar and mobile menu.
- **Auth Components**: Components related to authentication, like login and registration forms.
- **Feature Components**: Components specific to certain features or pages.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication system is built with NextAuth.js and follows these principles:

1. **Server-Side Authentication**: Authentication state is primarily managed on the server.
2. **Protected Routes**: Certain routes (like `/dashboard`) are protected and require authentication.
3. **Multiple Providers**: Support for multiple authentication providers (email/password, OAuth).
4. **Session Management**: User sessions are managed securely with cookies.

## Styling Approach

The styling approach uses Tailwind CSS with some additional patterns:

1. **Utility-First**: Most styling is done with utility classes directly in the JSX.
2. **Component Classes**: For complex components, we use the `cn()` utility to combine classes.
3. **Global Styles**: Minimal global styles defined in `globals.css`.
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints.

## State Management

State management follows these principles:

1. **Local State**: React's `useState` and `useReducer` for component-level state.
2. **Server State**: Server Components for data that can be fetched on the server.
3. **Form State**: Form state is managed with controlled components or form libraries.
4. **Global State**: Minimal global state, primarily for authentication status.

## API Structure

The API follows a RESTful structure:

1. **Route Handlers**: API endpoints are defined in the `app/api` directory.
2. **Authentication**: Protected endpoints check for valid sessions.
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format.
4. **Data Validation**: Input validation for all API requests.

## Performance Considerations

The boilerplate is designed with performance in mind:

1. **Server Components**: Using React Server Components to reduce client-side JavaScript.
2. **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting based on routes.
3. **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component for optimized images.
4. **Font Optimization**: Using Next.js Font system for optimized font loading.
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Keeping external dependencies to a minimum.

## Security Considerations

Security is a priority in the boilerplate:

1. **Authentication**: Secure authentication with NextAuth.js.
2. **CSRF Protection**: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery.
3. **Content Security Policy**: Strict Content Security Policy headers.
4. **Input Validation**: Validation of all user inputs.
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies.
